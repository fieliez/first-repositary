      <h3>Their history</h3>
      <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.</p>

        They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23
        million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution
        of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. <br /><br />
        They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
        Triassic-Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their
        dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Reverse
        genetic engineering and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds
        are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods
        during the late Jurassic Period. <br /><br />
        As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the
        Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs
        can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian
        dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. This article deals
        primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

      <h3>People love dinosaures!</h3>
      <p>
        Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th
        century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions
        at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part
        of world culture. <br /><br />
        The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly
        monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular
        appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.
        <br /><br />
        Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant
        funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered
        by the media.

        "There's an incomparable rush that comes from finding dinosaur bones.
        You know you're the first person to lay hands on a critter that lived 80
        or 90 million years ago." <br />
